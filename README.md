# Gladiator-Robots
A Javascript Robot game

### About This Project

JavaScript—along with HTML and CSS—is one of the three foundational technologies of web development. While HTML and CSS define the structure, content, and layout of a webpage, JavaScript makes webpages fully interactive. To put it simply, JavaScript lets us "do things" in a web browser, such as watch a video by clicking a play button or comment on a friend's photo on social media.

In this module, we'll use JavaScript to build a browser-based video game that we'll enter in a fictional hackathon called the Con Solo Game Jam, which has the following rules:

## What is being done.

*The game must be created by a single developer in 24 hours.
*The game must run in a web browser.
*The game must use the provided index.html file.
*Only the <title> element of index.html may be changed.
*Participants cannot use CSS.
*All game code must be contained in the game.js JavaScript file.
*Communicate with the game player by using JavaScript functions.
*Assign and manipulate data using JavaScript variables and operators.
*Control the flow of the application by managing conditional statements.
  
There are many ways to approach this project, but this is how we'll do it:

1.Set up the project in GitHub. We'll create a new GitHub repository, issues, and branches. These are the basic steps for any new project.

2. Create the project files and structure. We'll set up the index.html and game.js file structure according to the Con Solo instructions.

3.Use JavaScript functions to display the game status to the player. JavaScript has some built-in functions that do this, and we'll also create our own functions to control when these messages appear.

4.Use JavaScript variables and operators to manage game data. We'll do a little math to keep track of robot health, player money, and other game values.

5.Make decisions using JavaScript conditions. For example, the game should allow a robot to fight if it still has health points, but not if its health points reach 0.

6. Allow the player to decide whether they would like to fight or skip the fight.
